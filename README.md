# Instructions:

To launch the GUI, open the program in Qt creator by opening GUI/Audio_Processing_GUI/Audio_Processing_GUI.pro. 
Go to build in the toolbar and click run and the GUI should pop up.

Input and output paths must be entered from disk using "/" to divide between directories. 
ex: on my windows computer the path would be 'C:/Users/jacob/Downloads/file.wav'

It only processes a file once so after processing, click reset program and enter a new file to read and process.

There is no scaling, so try to open on a 1080p monitor for the best looking version.

GUI/Audio_Processing_GUI/WaveFileEditor.cpp is where all the GUI code is.
